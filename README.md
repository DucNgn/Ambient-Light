# Photo Resistor (light sensor)
## General:
This is a part of my project in class where we have to work together in a team, and outline the strategy to organize, and host a tech workshop in the Concordia Sandbox Technology.

## Functioning:
A small program I wrote to program an Arduino to detect surrounding environment's light. Then reacts by increasing or lowering its brightness.
+ The LED brightness increases if lower surrounding light detected.
+ The LED brightness decreases if higher surrounding light detected.

## Requirements tools and software:
+ Arduino Uno kit.
+ Light sensor.
+ Arduino IDE.

## Usage:
+ Download/Clone this repository.
+ Use Arduino software to verify and upload to Arduino board.

## Acknowledgement:
+ This program uses resources from Sik Guide.
+ The equipment was rent from Concordia Sandbox Technology.
+ The equipment was an Arduino kit from SparkFun.
